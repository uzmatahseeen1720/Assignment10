    "Q.1:- Who developed python programming language?\n",
    "Ans:- Guido Van Russom\n",
    "\n",
    "Q.2:- Which type of programming does python support?\n",
    "Ans:- Python is a multi-paradigm programming language. Object-oriented programming and structured \n",
    "programming are fully supported, and many of their features support functional programming and \n",
    "aspect-oriented programming (including metaprogramming and metaobjects).\n",
    "\n",
    "Q.3:- Is python case sensitive when dealing with identifiers?\n",
    "Ans:- Yes, Python is a case-sensitive language, i.e., it treats uppercase and lowercase characters differently. \n",
    "This applies to identifiers too. You must avoid using the same name with different cases while naming identifiers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q.4:- What is correct extension of python file?\n",
    "Ans:- The Files with the .py extension contain the Python source code. \n",
    "\n",
    "Q.5:- Is python code compiled or interpreted?\n",
    "Ans:- Python is an interpreted language, which means the source code of a Python program is converted into bytecode\n",
    "that is thenexecuted by the Python virtual machine. Python is different from major compiled languages, such as C and C + +,\n",
    "as Python code is not required to be built and linked like code for these languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q.6:- Name a few block of code used to define  in python language?\n",
    "Ans:- The following are blocks: a module, a function body, and a class definition. \n",
    "\n",
    "Q.7:- State a character used to give single line comment in python?\n",
    "Ans:-  Hash character(#) is used to comment the line in the Python program.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Q.8:- Mention function which can help us to find the version of python we are currently using?\n",
    "Ans:- Using sys.version method.\n",
    "      Using python_version() function.\n",
    "      Using Python -V command.\n",
    " Here is some step that the user must follow to get the currently running version of the python interpreter:\n",
    "i) Open cmd/terminal/windows powershell\n",
    "ii) Write ‘python’ and press enter key to move into Python interpreter\n",
    "iii) Write the same command given in the input box below, and in the result, the user will get the current interpreter version.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q.9:- Python supports to make anonymous functions which are not bound to a name(@ runtime). \n",
    "  It uses a construct called \"lambda\" . This is not exactly the same as lambda in functional programming languages.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Q.10:- What does PEP stand for in python?\n",
    "Ans:-  PEP stands for Python Enhancement Proposal. \n",
    "\n",
    "Q.11:- Mention a few built in functions in python.\n",
    "Ans:- abs(x) for fetching the absolute value of x, bin() for getting the binary value, bool() for retrieving the boolean value of an object, \n",
    "list() for lists, len() to get the length of the value, open() to open the files, pow() for returning the power of \n",
    "a number, sum() for fetching the sum of the elements, reversed() for reversing the order.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q.12:- What is the maximum length for an identifier in python?\n",
    "Ans:-  An identifier can have a maximum length of 79 characters in Python. \n",
    "\n",
    "Q.13:- What are the benefits of python?\n",
    "Ans:- Highly extensible: We can extend python to other languages and write codebase and add functionality\n",
    "for C#, C, C++, Java and other programming language.\n",
    "Python Libraries: Speaking of adding functionality to Python – one of the major benefits of choosing Python as your programming\n",
    "language of choice (or even adding it as a second or third language) is the large amount of libraries you can incorporate into your code. \n",
    "Python Community:\n",
    "Without a doubt, one of the most important benefits of Python is its vast community of \n",
    "developers and software engineers. This community helps support Python – and thus Python developers – in numerous ways\n",
    "Python Is Easy to Learn\n",
    "Python is incredibly easy to learn, regardless of your age or experience level. It is part of the reason I wrote a \n",
    "book about programming in the language for teenagers – it is a great entry into programming software as a whole. \n",
    "Since the language is so simple to read and write in, it also makes a great second or third language to add to your developer resume.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q.14:- How is memory managed in python?\n",
    "Ans:- Memory management in Python involves a private heap containing all Python objects and data structures.\n",
    "The management of this private heap is ensured internally by the Python memory manager.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q.15:- How to install python on windows and set path variables?\n",
    "Ans:- Open a browser to the Python website and download the Windows installer. 2. Double click on the downloaded file and \n",
    "install Python for all users, and ensure that Python is added to your path. Click on Install now to begin.\n",
    "The complete path of python.exe can be added by:\n",
    "~Right-clicking This PC and going to Properties.\n",
    "~Clicking on the Advanced system settings in the menu on the left.\n",
    "~Clicking on the Environment Variables button on the bottom right.\n",
    "~In the System variables section, selecting the Path variable and clicking on Edit. The next screen will show all the directories that are currently a part of the PATH variable.\n",
    "~Clicking on New and entering Python’s install directory.\n",
